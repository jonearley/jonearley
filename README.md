# Hello, I'm Jon Earley!

I'm a **User Interface Design Engineer** building inclusive and accessible websites at the University of Michigan Library. I lead our [Design System team](http://design-system.lib.umich.edu/) responsible for our open-source platform for web teams to reuse common solutions and learn from one another.

Previously I was a Web Developer for Skokie Public Library and before that I was an Adjunct Web Developer for Grand Valley State University Libraries.
